# find-test-names [![ci](https://github.com/bahmutov/find-test-names/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/bahmutov/find-test-names/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> Given a Mocha / Cypress spec file, returns the list of suite and test names

## Install

```shell
# install using NPM, probably as a dev dependency
$ npm i -D find-test-names
# install using Yarn
$ yarn add -D find-test-names
```

## Use

```js
const { getTestNames } = require('find-test-names')
const result = getTestNames(specSourceCode)
// { "suiteNames": [], "testNames": [], "tests": [] }
```

The `tests` is a list with each test and suite name, and optional list of tags.

```js
// spec.js
it('works', {tags: ['@user']}, () => { ... })
// found test names
// { tests: [{ name: 'works', tags: ['@user'] }] }
```

### withStructure

You can get the entire structure of suites and tests by passing `true` argument

```js
const result = getTestNames(specSourceCode, true)
// use the result.structure array
```

To view this in action, use `npm run demo-structure` which points at [bin/find-tests.js](./bin/find-tests.js)

### Pending tests

The tests `it.skip` are extracted and have the property `pending: true`

### setEffectiveTags

Often, you want to have each test and see which tags it has and what parent tags apply to it. You can compute for each test a list of _effective_ tags and set it for each test.

```js
// example spec code
describe('parent', { tags: '@user' }, () => {
  describe('parent', { tags: '@auth' }, () => {
    it('works a', { tags: '@one' }, () => {})
    it('works b', () => {})
  })
})
```

```js
const { getTestNames, setEffectiveTags } = require('find-test-names')
const result = getTestNames(source, true)
setEffectiveTags(result.structure)
```

If you traverse the `result.structure`, the test "works a" will have the `effectiveTags` list with `@user, @auth, @one`, and the test "works b" will have the `effectiveTags` list with `@user, @auth, @one`.

### filterByEffectiveTags

Once you `setEffectiveTags`, you can filter all tests by an effective tag. For example, to fid all tests with the given tag:

```js
const {
  getTestNames,
  setEffectiveTags,
  filterByEffectiveTags,
} = require('find-test-names')
const result = getTestNames(source, true)
setEffectiveTags(result.structure)
const tests = filterByEffectiveTags(result.structure, ['@one'])
```

Returns individual test objects.

Tip: you can pass the source code and the tags to the `filterByEffectiveTags` function and let it parse it

```js
const filtered = filterByEffectiveTags(source, ['@user'])
```

### findEffectiveTestTags

Returns a single object with full test titles as keys. For each key, the value is the list of effective tags. See the [find-effective-tags.js](./test/find-effective-tags.js) spec file.

### findEffectiveTestTagsIn

You can use the utility method `findEffectiveTestTagsIn(filename)` to let this module read the file from disk and find the effective tags that apply to each test by its full title.

### requiredTags

The test and suite options object can have another list of tags called `requiredTags`

```js
it(
  'works a',
  {
    tags: '@one',
    requiredTags: ['@data'],
  },
  () => {},
)
```

These tags also will be extracted and the effective required tags from the parent suites applied to the children tests.

### Bin

This package includes [bin/find-test-names.js](./bin/find-test-names.js) that you can use from the command line

```shell
$ npx find-test-names <path to the spec file>
# prints the describe and test names found in the spec file
```

### print-tests

Print found suites an tests

```shell
$ npx print-tests <spec pattern>
```

For example, in this repo

```
$ npx print-tests 'test-cy/**/*.js'

test-cy/spec-a.js
└─ Suite A
  ├─ works 1
  └─ works 2

test-cy/spec-b.js
└─ Suite B
  ├─ works 1
  └─ works 2
```

Pending tests and suites are marked with `⊙` character like this:

```
├─ first
├⊙ second
└⊙ last
```

If there are tags, they are shown after the name

```
├─ first [tag1, tag2]
├─ second [@sanity]
└─ last
```

If there are required test tags, they are shown after the test name using double brackets `[[ ]]`

```
├─ first [tag1, tag2]
├─ second [@sanity] [[clean]]
└─ last
```

### Unknown test names

Sometimes a test name comes from a variable, not from a literal string.

```js
// test name is a variable, not a literal string
const testName = 'nice'
it(testName, () => {})
```

In that case, the tags are still extracted. When printing, such tests have name `<unknown test>`.

### comment lines

If the test function has preceding comment lines, the comment line right before the test is extracted and included

```js
// line 1
// line 2
// line 3
it('works', ...)
// extracted test object will have
// name: "works",
// comment: "line 3"
```

## Debugging

Run with the environment variable `DEBUG=find-test-names` to see verbose logs
